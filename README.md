# "Github Projects" - plugin for Strapi 4 ðŸš€

This plugin allows to automatically generate "Projects" from public Github repositories, meant to be then exposed via a public API, e.g. to be shown on a front-end application with the aim to showcase a developer's portfolio.

## How to install ðŸš€

```bash
# yarn
yarn add @minhtrn/strapi-plugin-github-projects

# npm
npm i @minhtrn/strapi-plugin-github-projects
```

## Initial configuration ðŸš€

In order to use this plugin, you need to generate a new personal token [on Github](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
The generated API key must then be set up for your Strapi app as an environment variable called `GITHUB_TOKEN` (add it to your `.env` file).
